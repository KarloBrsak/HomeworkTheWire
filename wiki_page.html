<p><em>The Wire</em> is an American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_film" target="blank">crime drama</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_show" target="blank">television series</a> created and primarily written by author and former police reporter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Simon" target="blank">David Simon</a>. The series was broadcast by the cable network <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO" target="blank">HBO</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" target="blank">United States</a>. <em>Wire</em> premiered on June 2, 2002, and ended on March 9, 2008, comprising 60 episodes over five seasons. The idea for the show started out as a police drama loosely based on the experiences of his writing partner <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Burns" target="blank">Ed Burns</a>, a former homicide detective and public school teacher.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire?useskin=vector#cite_note-simon-interview-4" target="blank">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Set and produced in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore" target="blank">Baltimore, Maryland</a>, <em>The Wire</em> introduces a different institution of the city and its relationship to law enforcement in each season while retaining characters and advancing storylines from previous seasons. The five subjects are, in chronological order, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade" target="blank">illegal drug trade</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port" target="blank">port system</a>, the city government and bureaucracy, education and schools, and the print news medium. Simon chose to set the show in Baltimore because of his familiarity with the city.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire?useskin=vector#cite_note-simon-interview-4" target="blank"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>
<p>When the series first aired, the large cast consisted mainly of actors who were unknown to television audiences, as well as numerous real-life Baltimore and Maryland figures in guest and recurring roles. Simon has said that despite its framing as a crime drama, the show is "really about the American city, and about how we live together. It's about how institutions have an effect on individuals. Whether one is a cop, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dockworke" target="blank">longshoreman</a>, a drug dealer, a politician, a judge or a lawyer, all are ultimately compromised and must contend with whatever institution to which they are committed."<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire?useskin=vector#cite_note-TAR-5><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>
<p><em>The Wire</em> is lauded for its literary themes, its uncommonly accurate exploration of society and politics, and its realistic portrayal of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_culture? target=blank>urban life</a>. During its original run, the series received only average <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_Media_Research target=blanks>ratings</a> and never won any major television awards, but it is now often cited as one of the greatest shows in the history of television.<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire?useskin=vector#cite_note-greatest-6 target=blank><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>
<h2>Production <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Wire&action=edit&section=1&useskin=vector" target="blank"><sub>[edit]</sub></a></h2><hr>
<h3>Conception <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Wire&action=edit&section=2&useskin=vector"><sub>[edit]</sub></a></h3>
<p>Simon has stated that he originally set out to create a police drama loosely based on the experiences of his writing partner <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Burns" target="blank">Ed Burns</a>, a former <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide target=blank>homicide</a> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective target=blank>detective</a> and public school teacher who had worked with Simon on projects including <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Corner target=blank><em>The Corner</em></a> (2000). Burns, when working on protracted investigations of violent drug dealers using <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance target=blank>surveillance</a> technology, had often been frustrated by the bureaucracy of the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Police_Department target=blank>Baltimore Police Department</a>; Simon saw similarities with his own ordeals as a police reporter for <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Baltimore_Sun target=blank><em>Baltimore Sun</em></a>.</p>
<p>Simon chose to set the show in Baltimore because of his familiarity with the city. During his time as a writer and producer for the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC target=blank>NBC</a> program <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide:_Life_on_the_Street target=blank><em>Homicide: Life on the Street</em></a>, based on his book <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide:_A_Year_on_the_Killing_Streets target=blank><em>Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets</em></a> (1991), also set in Baltimore, Simon had come into conflict with NBC network executives who were displeased by the show's pessimism. Simon wanted to avoid a repeat of these conflicts and chose to take <em>Wire</em> to HBO, because of their working relationship from the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniseries target=blank>miniseries</a> <em>The Corner</em>. HBO was initially doubtful about including a police drama in its lineup but agreed to produce the pilot episode.<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire?useskin=vector#cite_note-SLI-7 target=blank><sup>[7]</sup></a><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire?useskin=vector#cite_note-8 target=blank><sup>[8]</sup></a> Simon approached the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_mayors_of_Baltimore target=blank>mayor of Baltimore</a>, telling him that he wanted to give a bleak portrayal of certain aspects of the city; Simon was welcomed to work there again. He hoped the show would change the opinions of some viewers but said that it was unlikely to affect the issues it portrays.<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire?useskin=vector#cite_note-SLI-7><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>
